Cinnamon Rolls
=======================================
Delicious rolls with plenty of cream cheese frosting

Dough Ingredients
-----------
* 1.5 cups water, warm
* 2 1/2 tsp yeast
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp mildly flavored oil
* 2 tbsp granulated sugar
* 4 1/2 cups flour
* Optional: 2/3 cup walnuts, chopped

Filling Ingredients
--------------------
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 2 1/2 tbsp cinnamon
* 1/3 cup butter, softened

Frosting Ingredients
--------------------
* 1 stick (4 oz) butter
* 4 oz cream cheese, softened
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 2 cups powdered sugar

Steps
-----
1. Dissolve the yeast in the water. Mix in the rest of the dough Ingredients, reserving a small amount of flour to add if needed.
2. Knead the dough for 5 minutes.
3. Put the dough in a large, greased bowl in a warm location. Cover and let rest for 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size.
4. Turn out the ball of dough onto a large floured surface. Punch it down and flatten it slightly. Let it rest for 5 minutes.
5. With a rolling pin, roll the dough to roughly 15" by 20".
6. Spread the dough with the softened butter.
7. Combine the brown sugar and cinnamon until completely combined, then evenly spread across the dough. Pat lightly to pack into place. Add walnuts, if using.
8. Roll the dough into a tight cylinder. Cut into 12 even sections.
9. Place the rolls into a greased (or buttered) 9x13 pan, making sure that the loose end of each roll is held by either another roll or the pan. It looks neatest if they're all facing the same way.
10. If preparing in advance, cover and refrigerate. When you're ready to make the rolls, remove them from the fridge 1/2 hour to 1 hour before baking. If baking immediately, continue to the next step.
11. Cover the rolls and let rise for 1 hour or until double. While they're rising, preheat the oven to 375.
12. Bake the rolls for 17-19 minutes.
13. Remove from tray, let cool slightly, and serve with frosting.

Frosting Steps
--------------
1. Brown the butter: In a saucepan over medium heat, whisk the butter frequently until it turns golden brown. Remove to a heat-safe bowl. Let cool until soft but not runny. (You can also do this to only a portion of the butter if you want the browned butter flavor to be more subtle.)
2. In a stand mixer (or by hand if you're very brave), combine the wet ingredients with the whisk attachment. Once completely mixed, add the powdered sugar 1 cup at a time.
3. Let mix at high speed for several minutes. Several times, stop the mixer and mix the bowl with a spatula to make sure no parts are missed.
4. Serve immediately or refrigerate.
