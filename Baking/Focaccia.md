Focaccia Bread
==========

Ingredients
-----------
* 2.5oz flour
* 1/3 cup warm water
* 1/4 tsp yeast

* 12.5oz flour
* 1 1/4 cup warm water
* 1 tsp yeast
* 2 tsp salt
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* Large-grain salt, like kosher
* Topping herbs, like rosemary

Steps
-----
1. Mix the first set of ingredients in a large bowl. Cover the bowl, and leave at room temperature for 12-24 hours.
2. Add the additional flour, water, and yeast to the large bowl. Mix until completely combined. Cover and let rise for 15 minutes.
3. Mix 2 tsp salt into the dough. Let rise covered for another 30 minutes.
4. Fold the dough onto itself gently. Re-cover and let rise covered for another 30 minutes. Repeat twice (three total foldings).
5. While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 500 with a large pizza stone on one of the racks. You could also use an upside-down cookie sheet or something like a cast iron pan. You'll want this to get fully heated through, so make sure you let it preheat a long time.
6. Transfer the dough to a floured surface.
7. Divide the dough in half and shape them into rounds.
8. Into two 9-inch cake pans, add 2 tbsp oil and a large sprinkle of your coarse salt (1/2-1 tsp). Mix it evenly.
9. Place the doughs upside-down in the pans, then flip them (so it's now right-side up). Let rest for a few minutes, covered.
10. Stretch the dough with your fingers to help it fill the pan.
11. Stab each dough with a fork many times to prevent large bubbles from forming.
12. Sprinkle the herbs evenly over the pans.
13. Let the dough rest until slightly bubbly, about 10 minutes.
14. Reduce oven temperature to 450.
15. Place the pans directly on the pizza stone for 25 minutes (or until golden-brown), rotating the pans once during baking.
16. Cool the loaves on a wire rack. Brush the tops with any leftover oil in the pans.
17. Let cool for a few minutes so you don't burn the heck out of yourself.
