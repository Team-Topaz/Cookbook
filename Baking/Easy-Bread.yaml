  - Cover the bowl with saran wrap and leave it on the counter for 8-12 hours.
  - Preheat oven to 450F.
  - Remove the dough from the bowl onto a floured surface, then turn it out into a ball (knead a little if you feel ambitious).
  - Wait 30 minutes while dough rests.
  - Transfer dough to heavy dish with high sides, such as a casserole dish or dutch oven. Cover with aluminum foil (or a lid, if your thing has an oven-safe lid).
  - Bake for 30 minutes. Remove lid or foil and bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
  - Cool for 15 minutes before cutting.
