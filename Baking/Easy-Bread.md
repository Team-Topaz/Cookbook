1. Mix all the ingredients in the "ingredients" section in a large bowl.
2. Cover the bowl with saran wrap and leave it on the counter for 8-12 hours.
3. Preheat oven to 450F.
4. Remove the dough from the bowl onto a floured surface, then turn it out into a ball (knead a little if you feel ambitious).
5. Wait 30 minutes while dough rests.
6. Transfer dough to heavy dish with high sides, such as a casserole dish or dutch oven. Cover with aluminum foil (or a lid, if your thing has an oven-safe lid).
7. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove lid or foil and bake until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
8. Cool for 15 minutes before cutting.
