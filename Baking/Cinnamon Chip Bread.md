Cinnamon Chip Bread (Beta)
=======================================
A soft bread with cinnamon chips!

Ingredients
-----------
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
* 1 1/2 tablespoons butter, softened
* 1 1/2 tablespoons light corn syrup
* 2 1/4 teaspoons yeast
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 cup water, warm
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 1/4 teaspoons oil
* 3 cups flour, all-purpose


Steps
-----
1. Preheat an oven to 225F.
2. Mix the first 4 ingredients together in a bowl.
3. Roll the cinnamon mixture into a thin sheet between two sheets of parchment paper.
4. Remove the top sheet of parchment paper and bake the cinnamon mixture for 40 minutes on a baking sheet.
5. Remove the cinnamon mixture from oven. Turn off oven. Let the cinnamon mixture cool partially, then fold it in half (so it ends up twice as thick). Cool completely. Chop or break apart into small chunks.
6. In a medium bowl, mix water and yeast until the yeast dissolves.
7. Add sugar, egg, oil, and 1 cup flour and mix until incorporated.
8. Add salt and remainder of flour, reserving a small amount of flour. Mix until combined.
9. Knead dough for 5 minutes. Add flour as needed.
10. Flatten the dough, sprinkle a handful of cinnamon chips in, knead few times, and repeat until all chips are used.
11. Grease a large bowl. Add dough and turn to coat dough.
12. Cover bowl and let rise in a warm area for an hour or until doubled.
13. Seal up any holes in the outer surface of the dough by pinching the seams together, then punch down the dough ball, shape it into a ball, and transfer to a greased or parchment-covered baking sheet.
14. Cover ball and let rise in a warm area for an hour or until doubled.
15. Near end of rising time, preheat oven to 375 degrees.
16. Uncover ball and bake in oven for about 30 minutes, or until well-browned on the outside.
