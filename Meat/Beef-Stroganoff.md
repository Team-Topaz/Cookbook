Easy Bread
==========

Ingredients
-----------
* 2 lbs beef, sliced into thin, bite-sized pieces (Ground beef is OK too. You heathen.)
* 1 stick butter
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 2/3 cup shallots
* 1 lb crimini mushrooms, sliced thin
* 2 green onions, sliced, green and white divided
* 2 tbsp flour
* 1/3 cup white wine
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1 tsp prepared mustard
* 1 1/2 cup beef broth
* 1 1/2 cup sour cream

* Egg Noodles (For serving)

Steps
-----
1. Put the butter in a microwave-safe spouted container, such as a glass measuring cup. Melt completely, then let settle until there is a clear line between the milk solids (white) and the fat (yellow). Reserve the fat, discard the solids.
2. Salt and pepper the beef.
3. In a pan at medium-high heat, add half the butter. Heat until meat added to pan sizzles vigorously. Add the beef in small batches, removing to a bowl as it becomes well-browned.
4. Once all beef is removed, cook shallots and green onion whites in remaining fat. Remove to the beef bowl.
5. Add the remainder of the butter. Working in batches, add mushrooms to pan and brown well. Either push cooked mushrooms to side of pan or remove to a bowl.
6. Reduce heat to medium. Add flour and mix with remaining juices in pan. Cook for 1 minute, stirring.
7. Return all cooked ingredients to pan. Add beef broth, mustard, and nutmeg. Simmer for 1 hour or until beef is tender.
8. 5 minutes before serving, add sour cream and wine. Simmer at a very low temperature to avoid curdling your sour cream. Thin with additional beef broth, as needed.
9. Add salt and pepper, to taste.
10. Top with green onions and serve with buttered egg noodles.
