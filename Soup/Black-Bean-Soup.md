Black Bean Soup
=======================================
Warm, tasty! I typically used canned beans because they're easier, but you can replace them with 1 pound of dried, soaked, and cooked black beans.

Ingredients
-----------
* About half a pound of cooked meat - shredded pork works well
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 2 onions, chopped
* 1 carrot, peeled and chopped
* 3 sticks celery, chopped
* 6 garlic cloves (or more, I don't know your life), minced
* 4 cans (~60oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 tbsp chipotle in adobo, plus 2 tsp sauce from the can
* 1.5 tbsp ground cumin
* 6 cups chicken broth
* 2 tbsp cornstarch
* 2 tbsp water
* 2 tbsp lime juice

Steps
-----
1. In a large stock pot over medium heat, cook the onions, carrot, and celery in the olive oil until the onions are transparent.
2. Add the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds - until it's fragrant.
3. Add the spices and cook for a few seconds.
4. Add the chipotle, broth, and beans.
6. Bring to a simmer, and cook for 45 minutes.
7. Remove 1 1/2 cup solids and 2 cups liquids to a blender (or food processor, or immersion blender...) and blend until smooth. Return to the pot.
8. Add the meat.
9. Mix cornstarch and water. Add to soup until it is the desired thickness.
10. Remove soup from heat, add lime juice.
11. Serve with cheese, sour cream, or other tex-mex themed toppings.
