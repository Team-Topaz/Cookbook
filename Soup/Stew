Beef/Pork Stew
=======================================
It's hard to go wrong with this during the winter.

Ingredients
-----------
* 3 lb beef or pork, cut into half-inch cubes
* 2 large onions, diced
* 4 carrots, large diced
* 5 sticks celery, sliced
* 6 medium golden potatoes, diced in medium cubes (small enough to be eaten in a single spoonful)
* 10 cups beef broth
* Olive oil
* Salt/Pepper
* Thyme
* Bay Leaves
* 2.5 oz butter
* 2.5 oz flour

Steps
-----
1. Preheat oven to 400F.
2. Brown beef/pork in stock pot over medium-high heat. Remove to bowl.
3. Add vegetables (except potatoes) to stock pot. Cook over medium heat until onions are soft and lightly browned.
4. While the vegetables are cooking, toss the potatoes with a drizzle of olive oil, then salt and pepper to taste.
5. Roast the potatoes until crispy - about 40 minutes. Flip ocassionally during cooking.
6. When the vegetables are cooked, add the cooked meat, bay leaves, and the broth. Simmer while the potatoes are cooking.
7. When the potatoes are done, add them to the vegetables.
8. In a saucepan, melt the butter. Add the flour once the butter is fully melted and stir continuously with a whisk until the mixture becomes fluffy.
9. Add about half the butter/flour mixture to the stew, giving it a few minutes to fully thicken. If needed, add additional flour/butter to thicken to taste.
10. Add salt, pepper, and thyme to taste. Remove bay leaves.
