In some of my recipes, you'll notice I've referred to them as "Southwest" whatever - there's probably almost nothing Southwest about them, but I feel more comfortable claiming something as "Southwest" rather than "Mexican" or "Tex-Mex." In effect, what "Southwest" means is "basically I've added Carnitas, bell peppers, and other fajita fixings to this normal thing."
