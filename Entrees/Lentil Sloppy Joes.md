Lentil Sloppy Joes
=======================================
I like sloppy joes but I don't like paying for beef.

Ingredients
-----------
* 1.5 cup lentils, rinsed and picked over
* 2 cups beef broth (vegetable broth okay if you want a vegetarian version)
* 1 tbsp canola or vegetable oil
* 1 yellow onion, diced
* 1 red bell pepper, diced
* 1 tsp salt
* 1.5 tbsp chili powder
* 1.5 tsp ground cumin
* .25 tsp ground chipotle pepper
* 2 tsp paprika (smoked is better)
* 2 tsp granulated garlic
* 2 tsp prepared mustard
* .5 cup ketchup
* 1 can (15oz) diced tomatoes
* 4 tsp brown sugar

Steps
-----
1. In a small pot, add lentils and beef broth - just enough beef broth to cover by 1-2". Cover and simmer for 30 minutes, or until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the lentils are soft.
2. Meanwhile, add oil to a pan heated over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper, then sprinkle with salt. Cook bell pepper and onion until onion is turning brown, about five minutes.
3. Add chili, cumin, chiptole, and garlic. Mix in and cook until fragrant.
4. Add mustard, ketchup, brown sugar, and diced tomatoes. Mix and cook for 2 minutes.
5. Add cooked lentils and cooking liquid.
6. Bring to a simmer, then simmer uncovered until lentils are soft and the sauce has reached the desired consistency.
