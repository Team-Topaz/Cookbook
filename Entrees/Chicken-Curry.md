# Chicken Curry, West African Style: Affiong’s Recipe (as Transcribed from a newspaper article)

Chicken curry is very traditional in the North of Nigeria. Social life without it would be unthinkable. It is always a buffet dinner and usually served at 2 o’clock on a Saturday afternoon, usually accompanied by cold beer and preceded by many gin and tonics. A new cook was hired only after he had successfully prepared a chicken curry. Promotions, anniversaries, year-end or beginning, even weddings were celebrated with a chicken curry. No starters are served with it and I have eaten just about every type of sweet or dessert with it.

# Ingredients
* 2 chickens, cut-up
* Oil for frying
* 3 large onions, finely chopped
* 2.5 cups unsalted peanuts
* 2 fresh ginger roots
* 6 garlic cloves
* 2-3 cups coconut milk
* Curry powder (My Note: about 8 teaspoons curry to start)
* Salt

# Instructions 
1. Joint the chicken, divide breasts into 4 equal parts.
2. Fry until golden brown on all sides, remove from pan and keep warm.
3. Fry onions until transparent
4. Return chicken to the pan and add remaining ingredients which have been blended together in a blender.
4. Add water until chicken is nearly covered with liquid.
5.Let boil until chicken is tender. If necessary, thicken with flour and water mixture. I cannot give an exact measure for the curry powder as every kind is different in strength and flavor.
6. Serve with plain, boiled rice and condiments, such as chopped banana, pineapple, onions, toasted and plain grated coconut, peanuts.
