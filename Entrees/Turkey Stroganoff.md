Turkey Stroganoff
===============
So beef's kinda bad for the environment and turkey's a little better...

Ingredients
-----------
* 2 lbs ground turkey
* 1 tsp beef Better Than Bouillon
* 1 stick butter
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 2/3 cup shallots
* 1 lb crimini mushrooms, sliced thin
* 2 green onions, sliced, green and white divided
* 2 tbsp flour
* 1/3 cup white wine
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1 tsp prepared mustard
* 1 1/2 cup beef broth
* 1 1/2 cup greek yogurt
* Egg Noodles (For serving)

Steps
-----
1. Place the butter in a microwave-safe spouted container, such as a glass measuring cup. Melt completely, then let settle until there is a clear line between the milk solids (white) and the fat (yellow). Reserve the fat, discard the solids.
3. In a pan at medium-high heat, add half the butter fat. Heat until meat added to pan sizzles vigorously. Cook the turkey until well-browned (we want as much browning as we can get our hands on!) Near the end of cooking, add 1 tsp beef broth concentrate.
5. Add the remainder of the butter fat. Working in batches, add mushrooms to pan and brown well. Either push cooked mushrooms to side of pan.
4. Add shallots and green onion whites and cook in remaining fat. Add the milk solids.
6. Reduce heat to medium. Add flour and mix with remaining juices in pan. Cook for 1 minute, stirring.
6. Add butter solids and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. Return all cooked ingredients to pan. Add beef broth, mustard, and nutmeg. Simmer for 15 minutes.
8. 5 minutes before serving, add yogurt and wine. Simmer at a very low temperature to avoid curdling the yogurt. Thin with additional beef broth, as needed.
9. Add salt and pepper, to taste.
10. Top with green onions and serve with buttered egg noodles.
