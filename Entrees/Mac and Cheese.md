Baked Mac and Cheese
=======================================
No, the other kind of baked. NOTE: Something in this recipe is Not Right - there's way too much sauce for the pasta. Consider making a minimum of 1 lb pasta instead of the called-for amount.

Ingredients
-----------
* 8 oz pasta, macaroni is traditional but also boring
* 1 tbsp butter
* 2/3 cup breadcrumbs (italian seasoning is good)
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 4 tsbp butter
* 1/3 cup flour
* 3 cups milk, warmed
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* 1/2 tsp mustard powder (optional)
* 1/2 tsp dried chipotle pepper (optional)
* 3 cups shredded cheese (we use Costco's mexican blend because it's cheap), make sure you've got a cup worth of smooth-melting cheese like mozzarella.

Steps
-----
1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. Boil the pasta following package directions, but subtract 1 minute from package directions. Drain and toss with 1 tbsp butter.
3. Mix the topping (breadcrumbs, 2 tbsp butter, and 1/4 tsp salt), and set aside.
4. Melt 4 tbsp butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Once fully melted, add the flour and combine to make a roux. If you don't know how to make a roux, ~~read a cookbook~~ stir frequently and cook for several minutes. The mixture will get frothy and easier to stir at one point - cook for a few minutes after that.
5. Add 1 cup of milk and stir until well-combined.
6. Add the remainder of the milk and mix until well-combined.
7. Add salt and seasonings.
8. Cook for 5-8 minutes until it is a cream-like consistency. Thick, but not mashed potatoes.
9. Remove from heat and mix in cheese.
10. Add additional salt if needed.
11. Combine cheese sauce with macaroni in a baking dish. Top with breadcrumbs.
12. Bake for 25 minutes, until the top is golden brown.
