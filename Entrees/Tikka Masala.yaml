Ryan's Tikka Masala
=======================================
Okay, so it's a rough draft. It was better the last time, and I'm working on it, OK?

Ingredients
-----------
* 2tbsp curry powder
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1 tbsp salt
* 2 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp cayenne
* 2/3 cup greek yogurt, full fat
* 1.5 lb chicken, cut into small bite-sized cubes
* 2 tbsp canola oil
* 2 onions, diced (about 700g)
* 2 bell peppers, diced (about 400g)
* 2 tsp salt
* 1.5 cups misc vegetables - potatoes, peas, chickpeas, carrots, etc all work.
* 2 cans (15 oz) diced tomatoes
* 1 can coconut milk
* 2 tbsp canola oil
* 3 tsbp curry powder, divided
* 1/2 tsp cayenne
* 2 tsbp sugar
* 1 tsp ginger powder
* 2 tsp cumin


Steps
-----
1. In a plastic bag, combine the chicken with the first 6 ingredients, mixing to coat.
2. Add the yogurt to the bag and mix to combine.
3. Let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes in the fridge.
4. In a large pan over medium-high heat, add 2 tbsp oil. Add  combined onions, bell peppers, and any slow-cooking vegetables you may be using (potatoes, carrots). Sprinkle with the salt.
5. Stirring infrequently, cook the vegetables, allowing them to brown until very brown in places.
6. When the vegetables are nearly done, clear a well in the middle of the vegetables. Add the other 2tbsp oil in the well, then cumin, cayenne, and 2 tbsp curry powder. Allow the curry powder to cook in the oil for about a minute, until it begins to smell fragrant.
7. Mix the vegetables and curry powder to combine.
8. During the cooking process, begin heating the broiler. Distribute the chicken on a cookie sheet, leaving space between each piece, and leaving as much yogurt mixture on each as possible. Cook in the closest position available to the broiler for 10 minutes (or until browning begins), then stir to expose a new side of the chicken. Cook again until browned once more, then one more time. Set aside. (For me, it took 10 minutes, 5 minutes, and 3 minutes for browning)
9. Add tomatoes. Simmer until the liquid is thick, but not gone, about 20 minutes.
10. Add coconut milk, 1 tbsp curry powder, ginger, and sugar. Simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes.
11. Add chicken. Mix.
12. Serve over rice.
