=======================================
Nom

Ingredients
-----------
* 8 oz pasta, I typically use fun shapes
* 1 tbsp butter

* 2/3 cup breadcrumbs
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1/4 tsp salt

* olive oil
* 2 medium onions or 1 large onion, small slices (half the size of what you'd do for fajitas)
* 2 red, orange, or yellow bell peppers, small slices
* 1 can black beans (15oz), drained and rinsed
* 1 can diced tomatoes (15oz)
* 1 can corn (15oz), drained
* 2? cups prepared carnitas
* 1/2 tbsp chili powder
* 1 tsp salt

* 4 tsbp butter
* 1/3 cup flour
* 3 cups milk, warmed
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp onion powder
* dried oregano
* ground cumin
* cayenne pepper
* 1/2 tsp dried chipotle pepper (optional)
* 3 cups shredded cheese (we use Costco's mexican blend because it's cheap), make sure you've got a cup worth of smooth-melting cheese like mozzarella. Or don't, that's OK too, we really do just use the Costco stuff.

Steps
-----
1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. Boil the pasta following package directions, but subtract 1 minute from package directions. Drain and toss with 1 tbsp butter and add to 9x13 pan.
3. In a large pan over medium-high heat, cook the onions and peppers, sprinkled with chili powder and salt, until browned and slightly charred (don't stir too much), but not necessarily totally soft. Add beans, tomatoes, corn, and carnitas. Cook for a few minutes until the mixture looks fairly dry. Remove to 9x13 pan with pasta and mix.
3. Mix the topping (breadcrumbs, 2 tbsp butter, and 1/4 tsp salt), and set aside.
4. Melt 4 tbsp butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Once fully melted, add the flour and combine to make a roux. If you don't know how to make a roux, stir frequently and cook for several minutes. The mixture will get frothy and easier to stir at one point - cook for a few minutes after that.
5. Add 1 cup of milk and stir until well-combined.
6. Add the remainder of the milk and mix until well-combined.
7. Add salt and seasonings. Adjust proportions of garlic, onion, oregano, cumin, and cayenne to taste.
8. Cook for 2-3 minutes until it is a cream-like consistency. Thick, but not mashed potatoes.
9. Remove from heat and mix in cheese.
10. Add additional salt if needed.
11. Combine cheese sauce with macaroni and vegetable mix in 9x13 dish. Top with breadcrumbs.
12. Bake for 20 minutes, until the top is golden brown.
