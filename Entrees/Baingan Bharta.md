Baingan Bharta
=======================================
Indian-inspired eggplant dish - very good when done well, but this recipe is decidedly beta software.

Ingredients
-----------
* 3 eggplants
* 1 tbsp garam masala
* Plain oil for skillet cooking
* 1.5 large onions, chopped
* 3 tomatoes
* 1 tsbp fresh ginger, minced
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tsp ground toasted cumin
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 bell pepper, red or orange
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1/3 cup green peas
* 1/4 cup chopped cilantro for garnish

Steps
-----
1. In a preheated 450F oven, roast the eggplants. This is left as an exercise to the chef, because I don't want to write how to roast a gourd. (Eggplant is not a gourd but still) It'll probably take about 45 minutes.
2. After cooled enough to handle, skin the eggplant and chop into small pieces.
3. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add 2 tbsp oil. Once the oil is hot, add the onion and bell pepper and cook until onion turns golden brown.
4. Add the eggplant, ginger, and garlic. Cook for two minutes.
5. Reduce heat to medium. Add tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes.
6. Add cumin, salt and cayenne pepper. Cook 5 minutes.
7. Add peas. Simmer for 10 minutes.
8. Garnish with cilantro.
