Pasta Sauce
=======================================
A delicious way to use extra tomatoes from the garden.

Ingredients
-----------
* 2 pounds tomatoes, cut into quarters
* 1 head of garlic, smashed and peeled
* 2 tsp olive oil
* Salt

* 8 oz italian sausage
* 1 oz wine or other deglazing liquid
* 4 tbsp butter
* Cream
* 2 tbsp fresh oregano
* Salt and pepper to taste

Steps
-----
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2. Add the tomatoes and garlic to a large casserole or roasting pan and drizzle them with olive oil and salt.
3. Bake 45-90 minutes until tomatoes are "jammy" and darkened around the edges.
4. When the tomatoes are looking close to done, start cooking the sausage in a pan large enough to accommodate the tomatoes later.
5. Cook sausage until golden brown, then deglaze the pan with wine.
6. Add tomatoes and butter. Cook until butter has melted and sauce has reached desired consistency.
7. Reduce heat to low and allow to cool to avoid curdling cream. Add cream and oregano.
8. Season with salt and pepper.
