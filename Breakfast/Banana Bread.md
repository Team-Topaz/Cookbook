Banana Bread
=======================================
Delicious. Uses a lot of bananas.

Ingredients
-----------
* 1 3/4 cups flour (8.75oz)
* 1 tbsp cinnamon
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 stick salted butter, melted, but cooled (add 1/2 tsp salt if unsalted)
* 5 bananas (about 2 pounds)
* 2 eggs, large
* 3/4 cup brown sugar, packed (5.25oz)
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped coarsely
* Granulated sugar for sprinkling

Steps
-----
1. Peel the bananas, place them in a large microwave-safe bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a plate. Microwave for 5 minutes. When done, the bananas should have released liquid and be soft.
2. In a preheated oven at 350, toast the walnuts for about 7 minutes.
3. If it's not already melted, melt the butter, and set it aside to let it cool.
4. When the bananas are done cooking, place them in a sieve placed on top of a saucepan on medium heat. Periodically rotate the bananas in the sieve to help them drain (like you're flipping pancakes). Do this for about 15 minutes, until the bananas stop letting off liquid. Remove them to the bowl they were cooked in.
5. Continue to boil the banana liquid until it is reduced to about 1/4 cup. Add the banana liquid to the banana bowl.
6. Mash the bananas with a fork. It doesn't need to be perfectly smooth, roughly mashed is fine.
7. To the bananas, add the melted butter, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Mix well.
8. Making sure the banana mixture isn't so hot it'll cook the eggs, add the eggs to the banana mixture and mix well.
9. Mix the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt (if using) in another bowl.
10. Combine the wet and dry ingredients and mix just until there's no dry flour remaining.
11. Fold in the walnuts.
12. Pour the batter into a greased loaf pan.
13. Sprinkle a few tsp of granulated sugar on the top of the loaf.
14. Bake the loaf in the 350F oven for 1 hour, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
