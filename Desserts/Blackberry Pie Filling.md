Blackberry Pie Filling (Frozen Berries)
=======================================
Would probably work for other berries, too... But why would you eat a different berry?

Ingredients
-----------
* 5 1/2 cups blackberries, frozen (or other, inferior berries, I guess)
* 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar
* 2 tbsp butter, melted
* 1/8 tsp salt (omit if your butter is salted)
* 5 tbsp Cornstarch
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 1/2 Tsp Cinnamon

Steps
-----
1. Put the berries in a large bowl. Defrost them lightly if needed, just enough to seperate.
2. Mix the dry ingredients in a seperate bowl to combine.
3. Mix the berries with the melted butter and lemon juice.
4. Toss berries with dry ingredients.
5. Add to pie crust and bake! With the crust I use, it should take about 50 minutes at 400F, plus a possible extra half hour at 350F with a baking sheet underneath the pie pan.
