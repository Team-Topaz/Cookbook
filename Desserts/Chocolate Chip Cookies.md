Browned butter is better than normal butter.

* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Steps

1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt one stick of butter. Once melted, stir occassionally until the butter starts to foam, then stir continuously until the butter smells nutty and looks browned. Remove from heat and pour into a mixing bowl to cool. In the meantime, set the other on the counter to let it come to room temperature.
2. Wait for the browned butter to cool and the other butter to come to room temperature.
3. In the mixing bowl, add the brown sugar.
4. Mix in the vanilla extract.
5. Add the softened butter to the mixture along with the granulated sugar. Mix until fluffy.
6. Mix in the egg and egg yolk until well-combined.
7. Add flour, salt, and baking soda until integrated.
8. Fold in the nuts and chocolate chips.
9. Bake the 1 tablespoon-sized cookies, sprinkled with sea salt, in a preheated 350F oven for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown.
