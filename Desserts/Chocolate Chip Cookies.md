Chocolate Chip Cookies
=======================================
Browned butter is better than normal butter.

Ingredients
-----------
* 2 sticks salted butter, room temperature
* 1 cup dark brown sugar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon molasses
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 large egg yolk

* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 cup chocolate chips
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
* Coarse sea salt

Steps
-----
1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt one stick of butter. Once melted, stir occassionally until the butter starts to foam, then stir continuously until the butter smells nutty and looks browned. Remove from heat and pour into a heat-safe container to cool.
2. Mix the remaining butter with the brown sugar until smooth.
3. Add and mix in the molasses and vanilla extract.
4. When the butter has cooled (20-30 minutes), add it to the mixture along with the granulated sugar. Mix until fluffy.
5. Mix in the egg yolk until well-combined.
6. Add flour, salt, and baking soda until integrated.
7. Fold in the nuts and chocolate chips.
8. Bake the 2 tablespoon-sized cookies, sprinkled with sea salt, in a preheated 350F oven for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown.
