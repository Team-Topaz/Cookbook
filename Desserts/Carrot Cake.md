Carrot Cake
=======================================
Because cream cheese frosting is the best frosting.

Ingredients
-----------
* 1.5 cups all purpose flour
* 1.5 tsp baking powder
* 1.5 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp ground cinnamon
* Generous grating of fresh nutmeg
* 1.5 cups sugar
* 3 eggs
* 1 cup butter, melted
* 3 cups grated carrots
* 1 cup chopped walnuts

Frosting Ingredients
--------------------
* 8 oz (one package) cream cheese, room temperature
* 8 oz (two sticks) butter
* 2 tsp water
* 2 tsp vanilla
* 4 cups powdered sugar

Steps
-----
1. Preheat oven to 350F. Grease two 9" cake pans, and line the bottoms with a sheet of parchment paper.
2. Mix together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl.
3. Mix together the sugar and eggs until smooth and well-combined. Add the oil and mix to combine, then slowly add the dry ingredients.
4. With as little mixing as possible, add the carrots and nuts.
5. Evenly distribute the batter between the two pans.
6. Bake for 40-50 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.
7. While the cake is baking, prepare the frosting:
  1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter.
  1. Stirring frequently, cook the butter until it has a light brown color and smells nutty.
  1. Remove the butter from heat. Let cool to room temperature before continuing.
  1. Mix the butter and cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth and uniform in color.
  1. Add the water and vanilla, then add the powdered sugar in increments, mixing between each addition.
8. Remove the cake from the oven. Let the cakes cool completely in the refrigerator before attempting to remove them from the pans.
9. Frost the cake.
