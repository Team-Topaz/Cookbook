Fudgy Brownies
=======================================
These are quite dark, and warrant some better-than-average cocoa powder.

Ingredients
-----------
* 10 tbsp butter
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 3/4 cup plus 2 tbsp cocoa powder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs, cold
* 1/2 cup flour
* 2/3 cup chopped walnuts

Steps
-----
1. Preheat oven to 325F.
2. Line an 8-inch baking pan with parchment paper.
3. Simmer 1-2 inches of water in a medium saucepan. In a bowl which fits over the saucepan without setting in the water, mix the butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. Stir occasionally until the butter melts and the mixture is warm. Remove from heat to cool the mixture 3-5 minutes.
4. Add vanilla and eggs, mixing well after each addition.
5. Add flour and stir until fully incorporated. Stir an additional 1 minute.
6. Add nuts and mix.
7. Pour into prepared pan.
8. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until a toothpick comes out nearly clean.
